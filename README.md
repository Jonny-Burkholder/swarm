# swarm
The ultimate API testing tool

## API Testing

SWARM exists to test your API in every conceivable way! Made primarily for load testing, SWARM is also more than capable of running functional test suites, replacing cumbersome software with simple YAML suites

## Benchmarking

In addition to sending requests and receiving responses, SWARM collects benchmarking data to see where your API weak and strong points are. Couple this with robuts profiling to optimize your APIs.

Save runs to compare api versions

## Compare

Create and server html charts comparing different run

## Easy test suites

Instead of hand-writing test runs or using curl (nothing wrong with curl!), define simple YAML test suites and run them in one line from the terminal

## Looking for contributors!

Development of open-source software is hard, especially when we all have day jobs. We do it because we love free tech and sharing knowledge. If you like this project idea and would like to help, please reach out!

## Philosophy

I am a human, and I make software for other humans. Despite having a copilot.md file, not a drop of this code is AI generated, and I'd like to keep it that way. Hand-writing code keeps me sharp, and it helps to ensure that code is actually functional, and not just plausible. LLM-generated pull requests will be rejected and the offending contributor will be banned. Feel free to use AI to help you understand the code and architecture, but please write the code yourself if you're looking to contribute
